* timeout while receiving data?

* orca/merlin compatability


* gopher -I http://yahoo.com ; gopher -I http://someplace else
- the second invocation sometimes returns the results of the first.
- seems to be an issue with the DNS lookup as it is, in fact, connecting
  to the wrong address.

- gopher -i http://... crashed, possibly in setfileattr (which should have even been called)


----
fixed

* "-o file" to output to a named file.  
* "-O" to output to file based on url
* timeout for URL connection.

* set filetype/auxtype based on extension? (mostly for .c/.h files)


* Marinetti ReadLine bug?
- TCPIPReadLineTCP rlrBuff.count is sometimes wildly inaccurate.
- bug identified.  Using ReadLine2 as a workaround (plus it's easier)
