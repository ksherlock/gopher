* set filetype/auxtype based on extension? (mostly for .c/.h files)


----
fixed

* "-o file" to output to a named file.  
* "-O" to output to file based on url
* timeout for URL connection.


* Marinetti ReadLine bug?
- TCPIPReadLineTCP rlrBuff.count is sometimes wildly inaccurate.
- bug identified.  Using ReadLine2 as a workaround (plus it's easier)
