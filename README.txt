Gopher requires GNO (2.0.4, perhaps 2.0.6) and Marinetti (3.0b5).Usage:gopher [-o filename] [-O] gopher-url-o filename: save as filename-O: save as the remote filenamegopher urls look like:gopher://server:port/pathwhere :port is optional.  The first character of path is actuallythe type code (5 and 9 are binary, others are text).A blank path is assumed to be a directory listing but could be anything.
